title: August Cryptology Workshop Fully Subscribed!
---


The Canberra Girls' Programming Network is pleased to announce that our Cryptology Workshop has been fully subscribed! 

We've had an absolutely overwhelming response. We've registered 55 girls for this event and we're both a mix of excited that we've
been able to register so many, and disappointed that we can't offer this opportunity to more.

To those who have registered - We're looking forward to seeing you on Sunday! To those who missed out, please email ASD.DISH@defence.gov.au to be added to our mailing list, and be the first to hear about our next event!
