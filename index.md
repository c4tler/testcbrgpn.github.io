**It has never been a more exciting time to be a girl in IT!**

The Canberra Girls' Programming Network is aimed at girls in grades 4 - 12. Girls are introduced to a range of topics such as cryptology and games programming using the python programming language to develop their own program. Events are run several times a year by women working in IT.

So whether you're a coding guru, or just a beginner, come along to one of our events and meet women working in STEM industries. 

Check out our news page about our upcoming event.
